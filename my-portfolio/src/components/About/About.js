        <p className='About-detail-text'>
          With a recent graduation from an intensive web development course that earned me a Bac +2 degree, I've laid a solid foundation for my journey into the digital realm. 
          Eager to delve even deeper, I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in a 'Project Web and Mobile' program at Bac +3 level. 
          This academic pusuit goes hand in hand with real-world exposure through an internship contract, allowing me to seamlessly bridge theory and practice. 
          Join me as I weave code into captivating web and mobile experiences, drawing inspiration from the vibrant culture and innovation that Paris ignites within me.
